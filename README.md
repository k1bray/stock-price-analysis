# Summary of Project Intention

The intended purpose of this project is to take a closer look at the traded price performance of Netflix (NFLX) since its IPO in May of 2002 through April of 2024.  This was done by calculating various metrics that utilize the available objective data.  A comparison was made to the performance of the overall market during the same period by using the Select Sector SPDRs ETF that tracks the S&P500 (ticker symbol: SPY).

### Tools Used for Analysis

There were multiple tools used in the process of this analysis.  Using a server on a local device, a database was created and facilitated through Microsoft SQL Server and manipulated through VSCode utilizing the T-SQL database language.  Microsoft Word was used as the main platform for writing and editing the report of the analysis.  Tableau Public Desktop was used to create the visuals.  GitHub Desktop and GitHub were used as a hosting source for the version control and final rendering of the project report for publication.
